This repository contains the source code for [mikehathaway.com](https://mikehathaway.com), a personal website built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## How It Works

- **Framework**: [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) – a static site generator that turns Markdown and HTML into a full website.  
- **Hosting**: [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) automatically builds and serves the site directly from this repository.  
- **Branch**: The site is built and deployed from the `main` branch.  

## Development

If you’d like to build the site locally:

1. Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/).
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mjh2901/mikehathaway.com.git
   cd mikehathaway.com
