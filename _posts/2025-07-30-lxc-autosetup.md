title: Ubuntu LXC Setup
---

LXC Containers have become my goto solution for developmeint, demonstrations and frankly even some enterprise deployments.  They are smaller than full fledged virtualmachines and for utilities or low use applications present a lot less overhead on the server infrastructure.  They also have fewer attack vectors since they just dont have much softoware installed.  My goto setup is an LXC container running ubuntu with docker loaded in.
